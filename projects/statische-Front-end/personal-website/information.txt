Introduction:
My name is Jasper, I'm 17 year old student, starting my software developer doing my vocational education at Da Vinci College Dordrecht.
Most of my live i've been interested in computer related things, such as hardware and software.
A few years ago i started to take this interest more seriously and the start of my programming carreer took off.


Education:
I chose for the vocational education at Da Vinci College because my interest in programming peaked.
Since the school was close by home, had good teachers and a good overal vibe, made me pick this school.

During this study I've created multiple things I'm proud of such as my own text adventure game in python, this website and working with the robot-arm assignments was really fun as well.


More about me:
As my interest for computers took off, I picked up a few other hobbies as well, such as gaming, playing guitar

linux
