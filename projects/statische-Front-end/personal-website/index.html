                        <p>I'm a 17-year-old student with a starting career as software developer!
                            I'm currently doing my vocational education at Da Vinci College Dordrecht.
                            Most of my life I've been interested in computer related stuff
                            such as computer hardware and software.
                            A few years ago I started to take this interest more seriously
                            and the start of my programming career took off!</p>
